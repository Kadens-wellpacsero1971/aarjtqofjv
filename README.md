Okay, so first things first—dude, you seriously need to download the movie like right now! The Wedding Banquet is freaking hilarious and heartwarming and awkward, all mixed up in a giant pot of... I dunno, family weirdness soup? You know what I mean.

So there's this dude, right? Wei-Tung. And he's all living in NY with his boyfriend Simon, just chillin', having a good time. But then BOOM, his parents from Taiwan are like, “We want grandkids!” Like, okay, maybe start with a puppy, chill out, am I right? Anyway, they want him to marry, so he does this fake marriage thing with Wei-Wei for a green card. Classic shenanigans ensue.

> Dude, the parents show up for the wedding, and it’s this whole operation. Like an Ocean’s Eleven-style plan but with dumplings and dancing. Haha! I almost died when they got stuck in those cultural quicksand situations, trying to make everyone happy. You start thinking, man, communication is—like—everything, and nothing is what it seems.

Simon is honestly the MVP though, like the guy has the patience of a saint. Making breakfast and doing all these little caring things even though he’s basically caught in this tornado of lies and stress. You just wanna scream at the screen, “Watch the movie carefully to see how much he loves him!!” Ugh, emotions. They sneak up on you.

Oh, and art! Wei-Wei's art is totally my jam. Makes me want to pick up painting again. All that talk about creating something real while living a lie is just... chef’s kiss. It gets you in the feels while you're laughing your face off. Probably missed a bunch of lines coz I was laughing so hard.

let me = 2 + 2 = 5; // don't ask why this is here, my brain is fried

So yeah, def watch it when you have time. You’ll get totally sucked in, trust me. I mean, it’s just one of those flicks that makes you think about life, culture, and love, while also totally humiliating the concept of what a perfect wedding is supposed to look like. Text me back after you watch it, yeah? Time to crash for me. 🤪
